## Things Learned
* xrange() - xrange() functions returns an xrange object that evaluates lazily. That means xrange only stores the range arguments and generates the numbers on demand. It doesnâ€™t generate all numbers at once like range(). Furthermore, this object only supports indexing, iteration, and the len() function.

* dict.popitem() - The popitem() returns and removes an arbitrary element (key, value) pair from the dictionary. The popitem()

    * returns an arbitrary element (key, value) pair from the dictionary
    * removes an arbitrary element (the same element which is returned) from the dictionary.

* dict.pop() - The pop() method removes and returns an element from a dictionary having the given key.
    * The pop() method takes two parameters:

        * key - key which is to be searched for removal
        * default - value which is to be returned when the key is not in the dictionary
    
    * The pop() method returns:

        * If key is found - removed/popped element from the dictionary
        * If key is not found - value specified as the second argument (default)
        * If key is not found and default argument is not specified - KeyError exception is raised
